# macro-seminar
This repository contains the code for a final project of a research seminar, where I analyzed the relationship between central bank independence and the consumer price index for countries in the Pacific Alliance. The results demonstrated that there is a statistically significant negative relationship between the Central Bank Independence Index and the Consumer Price Index for the selected countries. The results hold under the application of an IV regression, using the countries' current account as an instrument, and are therefore robust.

## 📚 Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `macro_seminar.py`: This script contains the code for plotting all the graphs used in the project.
- `macro_seminar.do`: This script contains the code for performing the IV and OLS regressions.
- 📊 data: This directory holds the datasets used in the analysis.
- 🖼️ output: This directory contains the generated images and plots.
